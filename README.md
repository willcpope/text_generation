# AI Text Generation
The goal of this project was to train artificial intelligence models to generate text.

## AI Model 1: The Works of H.P. Lovecraft
This model was trained using the complete works of the American writer of weird fiction and horror fiction, H.P. Lovecraft. The prompt used to generate text is a note found in Lovecraft's Commonplace Book where he kept a record of all of his story ideas. The goal was to see if the model could generate text that builds on the story note.

## AI Model 2: Destiny Flavor Text
This model was trained using flavor text from items in the video game, Destiny 2. The goal of this model was to see if the model could generate interesting in-universe ideas.


## Technology
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This project uses the Python package [aitextgen](https://docs.aitextgen.io) using OpenAI's GPT-2 architecture.

> aitextgen is a Python package that leverages PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers and pytorch-lightning with specific optimizations for text generation using GPT-2, > plus many added features.

## Results
* Success rate from website
* Best result from each model
